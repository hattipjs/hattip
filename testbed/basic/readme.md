# Hattip Basic Integration Tests

## Running

When the environment variable `CI` equals `true`, `pnpm run ci` will all the automatic tests. When the environment variable `CI` does not equal `true`, `pnpm run ci` will run its tests on an already running server. You can set the server address by setting the environment variable `TEST_HOST` which defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

To manually test streaming, run `curl -ND - 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/bin-stream?delay=50'` and observe the typewriter effect.

## Manual Tests

All environments that provide a local development server are tested automatically. But testing actual deployments is also desirable. Follow the instructions below to test deployments.

# `@hattip/test-client`

Test your HatTip endpoints without running server.

# TODO

- [] API design should be further refined, maybe.
  - [] Handling cookies. Should we use 3rd party module?
  - [] Hostname/IP. Currently it is always `localhost` .
  - [] Should it support external endpoint call like `fetch("http://example.com")`?
- [] Improve test cases.
- [] Package name. `@hattip/test-client`, `@hattip/test`, `@hattip/test-handler`, ...
- [] License. Use MIT like other packages?
- [] Packaging setup.
